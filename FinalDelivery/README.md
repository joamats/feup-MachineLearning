Analysis of Voice Data towards Biometric Identification: Gender, Age and Identity Classification

Due to size constraints, .dat files containing the data are not included. None of this code will run without them.
Please download it from GitHub's repository, at: https://github.com/M4riaLoureiro/ProjetoDACO. To run all the 
sent code, you will need all the 7 .dat files in the root of the repository.

As an alternative, you can generate the necessary .dat files from extract_features.dat. For that, you just need
to run data_preprocess.py and data_preprocess_all.py, which are inside "Dataset" folder. 
The 7 mandatory .dat files will then be created on the root of the project.

The dataset is also not included but can be obtained here: https://www.kaggle.com/ogechukwu/voice. It is not
be necessary for running this project, though.

All source code files can be found inside folder "Code".
